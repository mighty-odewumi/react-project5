# react-project-5


The project was to build a Meme generator that fetches meme images from an API.   

I learnt about making API requests in this project and how to use the useState Hook in React.

 
### I didn't add the whole React files but that's on purpose. Would probably deploy later but that is how I would do the remaining projects too.


Here is a [screenshot](assets/screenshot.png) of the page on the localhost.
